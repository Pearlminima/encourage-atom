# Encourage package

Coding can be hard, your text editor should encourage you!

Encourage is a silly little extension that provides a bit of encouragement every time you save your document.


The tagline for the Atom text editor is “A hackable text editor for the 21st Century”. As a Haack, this is a goal I can get behind.

It accomplishes this hackability by building on Electron, a platform for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technology (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The ability to leverage these skills in order to extend your text editor is really powerful.

I thought I’d put this to the test by building a simple extension for Atom. I decided to port the Encourage extension for Visual Studio I wrote a while back. For a lot of developers, this image rings true every day.
